# Managing Database Transactions
In this guide, you will learn about managing database transactions using Ballerina.

## <a name="what-you-build"></a> What you’ll Build 
To understanding how you can manage database transactions using Ballerina, let’s consider a real-world use case of a simple banking application. In this example, you will build a simple banking application, which will allow users to,

- **Create accounts** : Create a new account by providing username
- **Verify accounts** : Verify the existence of an account by providing the account Id
- **Check balance** : Check account balance
- **Deposit money** : Deposit money into an account
- **Withdraw money** : Withdraw money from an account
- **Transfer money** : Transfer money from one account to another account


Transferring money from one account to another account includes both operations, withdrawal from the transferor and deposit to the transferee. Thus, transferring operation required to be done using a transaction block. A transaction will ensure the 'ACID'properties, which is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.

For example, when transferring money if the transaction fails during deposit operation, then the withdrawal operation that carried out prior to deposit operation also needs to be rolled back. If not we will end up in a state where transferor loses money. Therefore, in order to ensure the atomicity (all or nothing property), we need to perform the money transfer operation as a transaction. 

This example explains three different scenarios where one user tries to transfer money from his/her account to another user's account. The first scenario shows a successful transaction whereas the other to scenarios fail due to unique reasons. You can observe how transactions using Ballerina ensure the 'ACID' properties through this example.

## <a name="develop-app"></a> Developing the Application
### <a name="before-begin"></a> Before You Begin
##### Understand the Package Structure
Ballerina is a complete programming language that can have any custom project structure as you wish. Although language allows you to have any package structure, we'll stick with the following package structure for this project.

```
managing-database-transactions
├── ballerina.conf
├── BankingApplication
│   ├── account-manager.bal
│   ├── account-manager_test.bal
│   ├── application.bal
│   └── dbUtil
│       ├── database-utilities.bal
│       └── database-utilities_test.bal
└── README.md

```
##### Add database configurations to the `ballerina.conf` file
The purpose of  `ballerina.conf` file is to provide any external configurations that are needed for ballerina programs. Since we need to interact with MySQL database we need to provide the database connection properties to the ballerina program via `ballerina.cof` file.
This configuration file will have the following fields,
```
DATABASE_HOST = localhost
DATABASE_PORT = 3306
DATABASE_USERNAME = username
DATABASE_PASSWORD = password
DATABASE_MAX_POOL_SIZE = 5
DATABASE_NAME = bankDB
```
First you have to replace `localhost`, `3306`, `username`, `password`, `5` with the respective MySQL database connection properties you need in the `ballerina.conf` file. You can keep the DATABASE_NAME as it is if you don't want to change the name explicitly.

### <a name="Implementation"></a> Implementation

1. Let's get started with implementing the database utility functions. Before accessing the database from ballerina, we need to have the SQL client connector. We also need a function to create databases from the code itself. 
File `database-utilities.bal` in the dbUtil package includes the implementations for the above-mentioned functions, which is attached below. Inline comments are used to explain the important code segments.

##### database-utilities.bal
```ballerina
package BankingApplication.dbUtil;

import ballerina.data.sql;
import ballerina.config;

// Function to get SQL database client connector
public function getDatabaseClientConnector () (sql:ClientConnector sqlConnector) {
    // DB configurations - Get configuration details from the ballerina.config file
    string dbHost = config:getGlobalValue("DATABASE_HOST");
    string dbUsername = config:getGlobalValue("DATABASE_USERNAME");
    string dbPassword = config:getGlobalValue("DATABASE_PASSWORD");
    var dbPort, conversionError1 = <int>config:getGlobalValue("DATABASE_PORT");
    // If string to int conversion fails, throw the error
    if (conversionError1 != null) {
        throw conversionError1;
    }
    var dbMaxPoolSize, conversionError2 = <int>config:getGlobalValue("DATABASE_MAX_POOL_SIZE");
    // If string to int conversion fails, throw the error
    if (conversionError2 != null) {
        throw conversionError2;
    }

    // Construct connection URL
    string connectionUrl = "jdbc:mysql://" + dbHost + ":" + dbPort + "?useSSL=true";
    // Create SQL connector
    sqlConnector = create sql:ClientConnector(sql:DB.GENERIC, "", 0, "", dbUsername, dbPassword,
                                              {url:connectionUrl, maximumPoolSize:dbMaxPoolSize});
    // Return the SQL client connector
    return;
}

// Function to create a database
public function createDatabase (sql:ClientConnector sqlConnector, string dbName) (int updateStatus) {
    endpoint<sql:ClientConnector> databaseEP {
        sqlConnector;
    }
    // Execute the create database SQL query
    updateStatus = databaseEP.update("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS " + dbName, null);
    // Return the update status
    return;
}

```

2. Next, we will create the `account-manager.bal`, which includes the account management related logic. It includes a private method to initialize the database and public functions to create an account, verify an account, check account balance, withdraw money from an account, deposit money to an account, and transfer money from one account to another. The function that handles the transfer money logic includes a transaction block to ensure that the transfer is successful only when both, withdrawal from the transferor and deposit to the transferee are successful. If one of these operations fail, the transaction will be aborted and all actions carried out before the failure will also be rolled back. 
Skeleton of the `account-manager.bal` is given below.

##### account-manager.bal
```ballerina
package BankingApplication;

import ballerina.data.sql;
import ballerina.log;
import BankingApplication.dbUtil;
import ballerina.config;

// Get the SQL client connector
sql:ClientConnector sqlConnector = dbUtil:getDatabaseClientConnector();

// Execute the database initialization function
boolean init = initializeDB();

// Function to add users to 'ACCOUNT' table of 'bankDB' database
public function createAccount (string name) (int accId) {
    // Implemetation
    
    // Return the primary key, which will be the account number of the account
    return;
}

// Function to verify an account whether it exists or not
public function verifyAccount (int accId) (boolean accExists) {
    // Implementation
    
    // Return a boolean, which will be true if account exists; false otherwise
    return;
}

// Function to check balance in an account
public function checkBalance (int accId) (int balance, error err) {
    // Implementation

    // Return the balance
    return;
}

// Function to deposit money to an account
public function depositMoney (int accId, int amount) (error err) {
    // Implementation

    // Return error if amount is invalid or account does not exist
    return;
}

// Function to withdraw money from an account
public function withdrawMoney (int accId, int amount) (error err) {
    // Implementation
    
    // Return error if amount is invalid or account does not exist or if balance is not enough
    return;
}

// Function to transfer money from one account to another
public function transferMoney (int fromAccId, int toAccId, int amount) (boolean isSuccessful) {
    // Implementation 
   
    // Return a boolean, which will be true if transaction is successful; false otherwise
    return;
}

// Private function to initialize the database
function initializeDB () (boolean isInitialized) {
    // Implementation 
    
    // Return a boolean, which will be true if the initialization is successful; false otherwise
    return;
}

```

The below code segment shows the implementation of function `transferMoney`. This explains how we can use transactions in Ballerina. Inline comments are used to explain the code line by line. 

```ballerina
// Function to transfer money from one account to another
public function transferMoney (int fromAccId, int toAccId, int amount) (boolean isSuccessful) {
    // Transaction block - Ensures the 'ACID' properties
    // Withdraw and deposit should happen as a transaction when transfer money from one account to another
    transaction with retries(0) {
        log:printInfo("Initiating transaction");
        log:printInfo("Transferring money from account ID " + fromAccId + " to account ID " + toAccId);
        // Withdraw money from transferor's account
        error withdrawError = withdrawMoney(fromAccId, amount);
        if (withdrawError != null) {
            log:printError("Error while withdrawing the money: " + withdrawError.msg);
            // Abort transaction if withdrawal fails
            abort;
        }
        // Deposit money to transferee's account
        error depositError = depositMoney(toAccId, amount);
        if (depositError != null) {
            log:printError("Error while depositing the money: " + depositError.msg);
            // Abort transaction if deposit fails
            abort;
        }
        // If transaction successful
        isSuccessful = true;
        log:printInfo("Transaction committed");
        log:printInfo("Successfully transferred $" + amount + " from account ID " + fromAccId + " to account ID " +
                      toAccId);
    } failed {
        // Executed when a transaction fails
        log:printError("Error while transferring money from account ID " + fromAccId + " to account ID " + toAccId);
        log:printError("Transaction failed");
    }
    // Return a boolean, which will be true if transaction is successful; false otherwise
    return;
}
```

3. Finally, we will create the `application.bal`, which includes the main function. This file has three possible scenarios to check the transfer money operation of our banking application to clearly explain the database transaction management using Ballerina. Code is attached below, which also includes inline comments for further understanding.

##### application.bal

```ballerina
package BankingApplication;

import ballerina.log;

function main (string[] args) {
    log:printInfo("----------------------------------------------------------------------------------");
    // Create two new accounts
    log:printInfo("Creating two new accounts for users 'Alice' and 'Bob'");
    int accIdUser1 = createAccount("Alice");
    int accIdUser2 = createAccount("Bob");

    // Deposit money to both new accounts
    log:printInfo("Deposit $500 to Alice's account initially");
    _ = depositMoney(accIdUser1, 500);
    log:printInfo("Deposit $1000 to Bob's account initially");
    _ = depositMoney(accIdUser2, 1000);

    // Scenario 1 - Transaction expected to be successful
    log:printInfo("\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------- Scenario 1"
                  + "--------------------------------------------------------------");
    log:printInfo("Transfer $300 from Alice's account to Bob's account");
    log:printInfo("Expected: Transaction to be successful");
    _ = transferMoney(accIdUser1, accIdUser2, 300);
    log:printInfo("Check balance for Alice's account");
    _, _ = checkBalance(accIdUser1);
    log:printInfo("You should see $200 balance in Alice's account");
    log:printInfo("Check balance for Bob's account");
    _, _ = checkBalance(accIdUser2);
    log:printInfo("You should see $1300 balance in Bob's account");

    // Scenario 2 - Transaction expected to fail
    log:printInfo("\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------- Scenario 2"
                  + "--------------------------------------------------------------");
    log:printInfo("Again try to transfer $500 from Alice's account to Bob's account");
    log:printInfo("Expected: Transaction to fail as Alice now only has a balance of $200 in account");
    _ = transferMoney(accIdUser1, accIdUser2, 500);
    log:printInfo("Check balance for Alice's account");
    _, _ = checkBalance(accIdUser1);
    log:printInfo("You should see $200 balance in Alice's account");
    log:printInfo("Check balance for Bob's account");
    _, _ = checkBalance(accIdUser2);
    log:printInfo("You should see $1300 balance in Bob's account");

    // Scenario 3 - Transaction expected to fail
    log:printInfo("\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------- Scenario 3"
                  + "--------------------------------------------------------------");
    log:printInfo("Try to transfer $500 from Bob's account to a non existing account ID");
    log:printInfo("Expected: Transaction to fail as account ID of recipient is invalid");
    _ = transferMoney(accIdUser2, 1234, 500);
    log:printInfo("Check balance for Bob's account");
    _, _ = checkBalance(accIdUser2);
    log:printInfo("You should see $1300 balance in Bob's account (NOT $800)");
    log:printInfo("Explanation: When trying to transfer $500 from Bob's account to account ID 123, \ninitially $500" +
                  "withdrawed from Bob's account. But then the deposit operation failed due to an invalid recipient" +
                  "account ID; Hence \nthe TX failed and the withdraw operation rollbacked, which is in the same TX" +
                  "\n");
    log:printInfo("\n-------------------------------------------------------------------" +
                  "---------------------------------------------------------------------");
}

2018-02-16 07:16:33,601 INFO  [BankingApplication] - Explanation: When trying to transfer $500 from Bob's account to account ID 123, 
initially $500 withdrawed from Bob's account. But then the deposit operation failed due to an invalid recipient account ID; Hence 
the TX failed and the withdraw operation rollbacked, which is in the same TX

### <a name="unit-testing"></a> Writing Unit Tests 

In ballerina, the unit test cases should be in the same package and the naming convention should be as follows,
* Test files should contain _test.bal suffix.
* Test functions should contain test prefix.
  * e.g.: testCreateAccount()

This guide contains unit test cases for each method implemented in `database-utilities.bal` and `account-manager.bal` files.
Test files are in the same packages in which the above files are located.

To run the unit tests, go to the sample root directory and run the following command
```bash
$ ballerina test BankingApplication/
```

To check the implementations of these test files, please go to `https://github.com/ballerina-guides/managing-database-transactions/blob/master/BankingApplication/` and refer the respective folders of `database-utilities.bal` and `account-manager.bal` files.
